## Type away

Goal: be able to practice typing with learning materials, articles, code etc. 
- Speed, instantaneous, average. 
- Mistakes, keep count
- Rolling text, displays how many symbols left. Up to three lines at a time.
- Colors the output? potentially. Given we are on the last character of the line, line contains no errors and we hit enter -> line disappears.

So need top line for ui/metrics. 
Need to put a cursor on a string.
Need to listen to input from keyboard. 
Character in -> is it the same-ish(accents n shit) as the character under cursor? Correct: else error. 

Feed in any text.
